## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, 

Since Winnie-The-Pooh is now public domain, I wanted to share Pooh's wisdom and love for honey! I wanted to create a REST API that responded to a simple GET with a JSON object filled with sayings straight from the Hundred-Acre-Wood.  There is a little object that can easily be replaced by a full database that serves to provide a source of quotes.  E. H. Shepard's illustrations from *The House At Pooh Corner* are wonderful, imagination-expanding and public domain and so served as inspiration for the front-end.  

## Optimizations

Would like to add query parameter functionality to make it more useful.  Maybe a little EJS can help me build pages to previews of the quotes.  I would also like to add a link that creates a tweet from the quote.  
Would like to make the app lighter by offloading the image assets to a media provider.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first real node/express project that didn't follow a tutorial.  This was simultaneously simpler and more complicated than expected and really deepened my understanding of request-response patterns.  I just love Winnie-The-Pooh and I hope to add to this in the future!
